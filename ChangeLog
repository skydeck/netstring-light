2012-07-20  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@samsung>

	* Release Ocamlnet-3.6

	* Netsys_sem: a new abstraction for emulating anonymous
	  semaphores on systems that only provide named semaphores,
	  like OS X. All users of semaphores inside Ocamlnet now
	  base on Netsys_sem.

2012-07-19  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@samsung>

	* reimplementing Netstring_str for the case the Str engine
	  is used. It is now thread-safe without having to use
	  mutexes.

	* The default is now -disable-pcre

	* The module Netstring_pcre has been moved to a library of its
	  own, namely netstring-pcre. It is only installed if -enable-pcre

	* Fixes for OpenBSD (by Christopher Zimmermann)

	* Netcgi connectors (SCGI, AJP, FCGI): unifying the ~sockaddr
          and ~port arguments. ~port now also assumes a loopback binding.
          (Suggested by Christopher Zimmermann).

2012-03-15  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Allowing posix_spawn again for MacOS. It turns out the

	  allowing it to wait via file descriptor polling.

2012-02-16  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@samsung>

	* Http_client: fixing the case that a non-idempotent request
	  needs authentication, but should always be tried again even
	  if reconnect_mode does not allow to create a new connection.

	* Netplex: making many container methods/functions thread-safe

2012-02-15  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@samsung>

	* Uq_mt: this new module coordinates access to shared
	  engine-based resources from multiple threads (e.g.
	  share an RPC client by several threads)

	* Uq_ssl + Https_client: fixing problem when the client
	  times out while still connecting. Before, the module closed the
	  file descriptor too early. (Thanks to Henry Hughes for
	  reporting.)

2012-02-14  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@samsung>

	* XDR/RPC: implemented direct mapping from byte representation
	  to Ocaml value. Use new switch -direct with ocamlrpcgen to
	  enable.

2012-02-10  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@samsung>

	* Xdr: additional check against invalid XDR messages.

	* Xdr: calling Netnumber instead of Rtypes

	* Netnumber: speeding int8 readers and writers up (only on
	  64 bit systems)

2012-02-08  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@samsung>

	* epoll: Adding support. This is exported as "event aggregator" in
	  Netsys_posix (the API is prepared for other poll implementations).
	  There is also Netsys_pollset_posix.accelerated_pollset.

	* Netplex: Adding container_event_system and container_run
	  to [processor_hooks] so users can override these functions
	  (for using Lwt in Netplex containers).

2012-02-06  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@samsung>

	* Netsys_posix: Adding a second implementation for spawn
	  basing on posix_spawn

2012-02-05  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@samsung>

	  operations with nanosecond resolution

	* Netlog and Netdate have been extended to support high
	  resolution clocks. New "nanos" field in Netdate.t.

	* Netsys_posix: Adding event abstraction. Under Linux this is backed by
	  eventfd and timerfd. For other OS, an emulation with pipes is
	  available.

	* Netsys_posix: Adding POSIX timers. They can be connected with
	  events (the event is signaled when the timer expires).

	* Netsys in general: Splitting netsys_c.c up into several files.
	  Improved configure script.

	* Netplex_log: Using the new standard formatter.

2012-01-23  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@samsung>

	* Fix memory leak: Adding finalizer for Netsys_posix.poll_mem
	  values (thanks to Henry Hughes)

	* Fix (build): ocamlrpcgen respects existing OCAMLPATH
	  (Dmitry Grebeniuk)

2011-12-30 Gerd Stolpmann <gerd@gerd-stolpmann.de>

        * Security: adding limit max_arguments to Netcgi. This is more
          a general measure of precaution against DoS attacks where
          a specially crafted POST request contains many keys that
          collide massively in the hash table. Actually, Ocamlnet is
          not directly vulnerable; however, application programs can
          nevertheless be when they access a degenerated hash table.

2011-10-12  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Release 3.4.1

	  algorithm. At the same time, Rpc_transport is improved
	  so it almost never calls write() several times with
	  small strings.

2011-09-10  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* bugfixes in the Netplex shutdown procedure

2011-08-30  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	operation

	* Ftp_fs: the get_password and get_account functions take the user
	name as input 

2011-08-23  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Build fixes for Ocaml-3.11. There were some regressions.

	  (new directives NetcgiRequire et al)

2011-08-05  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Released: ocamlnet-3.3.7

2011-08-03  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Netplex: new workload_hook. It is called whenever a
	  connection is accepted or terminated.

	* Netplex: new config conn_limit to set the maximum number
	  of connections a container can accept

	* Netplex: new config gc_when_idle to run Gc.full_major
	  when the container is idle for some time

	* Reducing memory consumption (Uq_io and users such as
	  Http_client, Netplex, Rpc) by recycling bigarray buffers
	  more quickly

	* New admin messages netplex.mem.major, netplex.mem.compact,
	  netplex.mem.pools, netplex.mem.stats

	* Docs netplex_admin.txt

2011-07-29  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Shell: calling subprograms did not work when multi-threading
	  was enabled because of a caml_leave_blocking_section
	  without prior caml_enter_blocking_section. This is fixed.

	* Uq_ssl: Changed the method of closing SSL tunnels. Before,
	  a close-notify SSL message was sent, and also expected by the
	  peer before the connection was closed on TCP level. Now,
	  we half-close the TCP connection immediately after sending
	  close-notify. This seems to fix some SSL sessions where the
	  server ignores close-notify, and only reacts on TCP closes.
	  This method of closing seems to be ok with the standard,
	  which is apparently not very precise on SSL closures.

	* Released: Ocamlnet-3.3.6

2011-07-20  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Fix filter in Rpc_server: they are no longer accidentally reset for
          longer TCP messages

	* Fix Http_client: avoiding an assert when the server immediately 
	  responds without awaiting the request

	* Mimestring: reimplementing the MIME scanner w/o regexps. Also new
          string processing functions for iterating over lines.

        * Nethttpd: banning all regexps in message parsing that could cause
          stack overflows 

	* Nethttpd: Returning better Content-Encoding for statically served 
	  files. In particular, the encoding of compressed files is taken
	  into account

	* Released: Ocamlnet-3.3.5
	
2011-07-12  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

2011-06-16  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Rpc_client: fix when trying several authentication methods:

	* Preventing errors "Netchannels: Suppressed error in close_out:
  	  Netchannels.Closed_channel" (tentative fix)

2011-04-28  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Reverting Netencoding.Url to the implementation used
	  in Ocamlnet-2. The new impl introduces some incompatibilities
	  with Neturl.

	* Ocamlnet can now also be built without PCRE! Just configure
	  with -disable-pcre.

2011-04-14  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Test release: 3.3.0test1

	* Netmulticore: adding a lot of modules for managing shared
	  heaps. Also contains a tutorial now.

2011-03-07  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Netnumber: better successor of Rtypes, with both big-endian
	  and little-endian support. Rtypes is still available as
	  legacy module

	* Xdr, Xdr_mstring, Rtypes: have been moved to the "netstring"
	  library part

	* Adding support for GSS-API: The generic interface is defined in
	  Netgssapi. ONC-RPC support can be found in Rpc_auth_gssapi.
	  The authentication framework of ONC-RPC had to be slightly
	  extended.

	* Adding the SCRAM authentication method. Also includes an
	  encapsulation as GSS-API method.

	* Rpc_client: one can now set the user identifier (also for Rpc_proxy)

	* Rpc_server: added is_dummy

	* Netsys_rng: secure random numbers on all platforms

	  up in the right order.

	* Netsys_posix: also allowing flags POSIX_FADV_* for better
	  compatibility with extunix.

	  struct for custom blocks. Also, some corner cases for
	  bigarrays have been fixed. Renamed Copy_custom to Copy_custom_int.

	* Netsys_mem: new function copy_value

	* Netcamlbox: it is now also possible to put messages with
	  int32,int64,nativeint and bigarrays into boxes

2010-10-01  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Nethttpd: Fixing a bug in Nethttpd_services that prevents in
	  some cases that HTTP connections with pipelining are correctly
	  processed. This bug showed especially up in conjuction with
	  Nethttpd_engine.

	* Nethttpd: adding encap args in Nethttpd_plex.

2010-09-09  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Released: Ocamlnet-3.0.3

	* Nethttpd: Nethttpd_plex.nethttpd_factory got new arg
	  processor_factory. This allows it to override this
	  factory. (Caveat: this factory must be polymorphic.)

	* Netsys: netsys_oothr.cma no longer contains a reference to
	  Thread. New archive netsys_oothr_mt.cma for this.

	* Netsys: resolving circular dep netsys <-> netsys_signal

2007-05-06  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@gerd-stolpmann.de>

	* Fix: For Unix domain sockets, getsockname and getpeername
	  may return EAFNOSUPPORT. This code is generated by the
	  OCaml runtime when it sees an address it does not support.
	  We handle this case as a connected socket with inaccessible
	  address. The problem was reported to happen for MacOS.

	* Fix: IPv6 is now supported by most functionality. Exception
	  is the SOCKS stuff.

	* Fix netcgi2: Improving compatibility of Netcgi1_compat,
	  such that nethttpd works together with netcgi2. Porting
	  examples/nethttpd/netplex.ml to nethttpd+netcgi2.
